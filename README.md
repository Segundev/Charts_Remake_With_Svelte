  <h1> Charts made with svelte and d3</h1>
</a>

## âœ¨ About
This project was to showcase some of the charts I developed using svelte and d3. My process usually involves prototyping on svelte repl, in this case, most of my charts were on the platform. I designed a user-responsive interface to show some of the charts as part of my portfolio as a developer

### Contributions and Inspirations

Initially most of the code were written in pure d3, I had to refactor the codes to make svelte as the basis of development. Some of the data and d3 code for the chart were from d3-graps. Examples of how to use svelte were inspired a lot from connor rothschild repository and course, he also has some tutorials on youtube that should help you grasp how svelte and d3 interacts with the dom

### List of Charts

1. Bar Chart
2. Column Chart
3. Area Chart
4. Scatter Plot and Line Chart
5. Others

# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
